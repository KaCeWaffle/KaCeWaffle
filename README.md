   <summary><h3>My Career Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my career journey in Graphic Design and Film Editing, i was a student who was passionate to learn new things and found out that those two things interesting and started to designing using picsart in the beginning. Then, i started to learn Adobe Tools such as Photoshop and Premiere Pro to utilize my skills well in Editing and Design. After pretty much mastering the basics of Photoshop tools and Premiere pro tools, i started to explore again and used Canva in several designs. My design career got a pause in my college life which i started my journey on Computer Science which i started to learn python and C++, afterward on my own initiative i started to explore HTML and CSS as basic web language and nowadays i'm starting to learn JavaScript. In my Cyber journey i have some experiences with kali linux being one of the OS i used to try pentesting and report writing on a simple machine. In my career i take many detour such as becoming a Organization leader and enhanced my soft skills especially in public speaking and team management. I learn some things in International Relations major too in my chance on free electives on my 4th semester and it was pretty much fun experience and i gained a lot of knowledge. Last, i masters in 3 languages. My unique point is i learned chinese for my first language in my life afterward i started to learn indonesia and followed by english.
